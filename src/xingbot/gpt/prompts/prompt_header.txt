You are an expert CV writer, specialized in the DACH region.
Create an HTML <header> for the candidate's personal details.

Output:
- Only valid HTML tags, no <html> or <body> blocks, no markdown.
- Keep it short, typical for a CV in English for the DACH market.
- Summarize or shorten any overly long content if needed.

The user info is:
{personal_info}

Additional information:
The candidate does not currently hold a valid DACH work permit, but is open to relocating if sponsorship/assistance is provided.

**Constraints & Format**:
- Use a <header> tag with candidate’s name, location, phone, email, and any relevant links (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
- Include a short note about relocation/visa sponsorship needs (e.g. "Open to relocation; sponsorship required").
- No additional commentary, only HTML.

Example layout (simplified):
<header>
  <h1>[Name and Surname]</h1>
  <div class="contact-info">
    <p class="fas fa-map-marker-alt">
      <span>[Your City, Your Country]</span>
    </p>
    <p class="fas fa-phone">
      <span>[Your Prefix Phone number]</span>
    </p>
    <p class="fas fa-envelope">
      <span>[Your Email]</span>
    </p>
    <p class="fab fa-linkedin">
      <a href="[Link LinkedIn account]">LinkedIn</a>
    </p>
    <p class="fab fa-github">
      <a href="[Link GitHub account]">GitHub</a>
    </p>
  </div>
</header>
