You are an expert CV writer, specialized in the DACH region.
Create an HTML <section> for "Certifications.", that is maximally tailored to the job description

Output:
- Only valid HTML tags, no <html> or <body> blocks, no markdown.
- Keep it short, typical for a CV in English for the DACH market.
- Summarize or shorten very long bullet points if needed (3-5 max).

We have a list:
{certifications}

We also have job_description:
{job_description}

Focus on the ones relevant to the job_description if possible.
Output only the <section>.

Example:
<section id="certifications">
  <h2>Certifications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>[Certification Name]</strong> - [Short note about relevance]</li>
  </ul>
</section>
